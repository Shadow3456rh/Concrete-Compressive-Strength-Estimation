# Concrete-Compressive-Strength-Estimation
A Machine Learning model that is trained on concrete compressive strength dataset by UCI
The New.ipynb file is used for hyperparameter tuning to get the best parameters for training the model
Main.py is where we trained our model and exported it along with the scaler in pickle file
implementation.py is where we developed a simple GUI which take the inputs and displays the estimation of concretes compressive strength on a label
